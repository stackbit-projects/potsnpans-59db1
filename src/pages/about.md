###### from the comfort of your own kitchen 

Hosted by experienced chefs, focusing on sustainable and quality dishes

Please meet our lovely chef, based in Munich: 
###### Moritz Cebulj
In terms of kitchen knowhow he's drawing experience from top notch restaurants such as "Schuhbecks in den Südtiroler Stuben", "Schuhbecks Fine Dining im Boettners" (both a michelin star and 17 points in guide GaultMillau) as well as "The Charles Hotel, Rocco Forte" (hotel of the year 2018).
Combined with a creative, warm and funlovin' personality, it should make for a lovely session!
